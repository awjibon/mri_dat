# MRI-Based DAT Uptake Assessment in Parkinson's Disease
Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging is commonly used for monitoring Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), where DAT uptake amount is computed to assess PD severity. However, DAT imaging has a high cost and the risk ofradiance exposure and is not available in general clinics. Recently, MRI patch of nigral region has been proposed
as a safer and easier alternative. 
This repository offers a symmetric regressor for predicting the DAT uptake amount from nigral MRI patch.
Note that, the susceptibility-map-weighted-imaging (SMWI) technique of MRI is used.
