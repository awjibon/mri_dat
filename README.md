# MRI-Based DAT Uptake Assessment in Parkinson's Disease
Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging is commonly used for monitoring Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), where DAT uptake amount is computed to assess PD severity. However, DAT imaging has a high cost and the risk of radiance exposure and is not available in general clinics. Recently, MRI patch of nigral region has been proposed
as a safer and easier alternative. 
This repository offers a symmetric regressor for predicting the DAT uptake amount from nigral MRI patch.
Note that, the susceptibility-map-weighted-imaging (SMWI) technique of MRI is used.
DAT uptake amount is commonly expressed as the specific binding ratio (SBR).

## Input Processing ##
From SMWI of the brain, extract right and left nigral patches where each patch encompasses a volume of `50x50x20` voxels centered at the corresponding nigrosome-1's centroid.
Pass these patches to the predictor to obtain the SBR score.

## Usage ##
`print(predict_SBR(right_nigral_patch, left_nigral_patch))`

## Dependency ##
`tensorflow 2.*`
